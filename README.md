# HealthProject
Health Project is a React Native Dashboard for Health data.
It connects to Apple Health Kit via [React Native Health](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/react-native-health) and displays a daily score based on the users' goals.
* Choose datasets to monitor like `Mindful Minutes`or `Calories Burned`
* Set personal priorities by changing how different datasets should influence the score (`Weight`)
* Monitor your progress over the last seven days and strive for 1000 points per week (140 per day)
